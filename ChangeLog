0.2.0
----------------------
* Fixed vorbis input...this was fixed by pretty much rewriting the existing vorbis input logic I had.
  I am now using vorbisfile for all of it, and added a single pthread call as well...
* I don't think 22kHz on input is working at this point (22kHz mono may work)...so if you can keep it to 44kHz then you'll
  have the best results. but to be honest, you shouldn't really be transcoding with any source that's not 44kHz stereo, 
  due to the major amount of artifacts that will probably be produced...

0.1.3
----------------------

* fixed a problem with the resampling logic which caused major weirdness with anything other than 44kHz
* if you changed the resampling settings but didn't restart the transcoder, then the new settings weren't being picked up..they are now.
* upgraded to a new version of BASSWMA (yet unreleased, but included with the binary distribution) with support for WMA captions.. (yay!)
* added a wait cursor
